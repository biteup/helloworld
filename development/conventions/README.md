# Conventions, Convetions

We all write code in our own unique flavour. Some great, some not so readible. To each his own.

However, to improve productability, let's all come together and agree on our coding conventions so everyone stays sane and happy!

Below are the lists of conventions Benri will adopt:

* [Frontend Conventions](frontend.md)
* [Backend Conventions](backend.md)
